<!--

    Many HTML tags are configured via attributes - images have an src attribute, links have an href attribute, etc. 
    Because we may need to set these dynamically when using a framework, Vue.js provides different ways to bind to attribute values. 
    Weâ€™ll see how you can bind to an attribute.

when you're working with HTML you frequently need to be able to set different attributes.
If we're going to be making our page dynamic, we will need to be able to dynamically set attributes.

for example: an image, the only way that we are going to display is to set values-> set values inside of those attributes
bind attributes from vue, inside of you utilizing what's known as a directive.

directives in vue are going to start with either the colon in certain cases for shortcuts.
